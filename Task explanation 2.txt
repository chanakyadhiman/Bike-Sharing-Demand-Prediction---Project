1️⃣ Importing Libraries

import pandas as pd → Used to load and manipulate tabular data.

import numpy as np → Used for numerical and mathematical operations.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt → Used to create visualizations and plots.

import seaborn as sns → Used to create clean and informative statistical charts.

import statsmodels.api as sm → Used to build and analyze regression models.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split → Used to split data into training and testing sets.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score → Used to evaluate model performance.

2️⃣ Loading the Dataset

df = pd.read_csv(...) → Loads the bike rental dataset into a DataFrame.

df.head() → Displays the first few rows to understand the data structure.

df.info() → Shows data types and checks for missing values.

df.describe() → Provides statistical summary of numerical features.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

df.isnull().sum() → Checks for missing values in each column.

df.dropna() / fillna() → Handles missing values to avoid model errors.

df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(...) → Converts date column into datetime format.

df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month → Extracts month for seasonal analysis.

df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year → Extracts year for trend analysis.

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

sns.histplot(df['cnt']) → Visualizes distribution of total bike rentals.

sns.boxplot(x='season', y='cnt', data=df) → Compares rentals across seasons.

sns.scatterplot(x='temp', y='cnt') → Shows relationship between temperature and rentals.

sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True) → Identifies correlations between variables.

5️⃣ Feature Selection

X = df[['temp','atemp','hum','windspeed']] → Selects independent variables for prediction.

y = df['cnt'] → Sets total bike rentals as the target variable.

X = sm.add_constant(X) → Adds intercept term required for regression model.

6️⃣ Train-Test Split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...)
→ Splits data to train the model and test its performance on unseen data.

7️⃣ Model Building (Linear Regression)

model = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train) → Defines the linear regression model.

results = model.fit() → Trains the model using training data.

results.summary() → Displays coefficients, p-values, and model statistics.

8️⃣ Predictions

y_pred = results.predict(X_test) → Generates predictions on test data

9️⃣ Model Evaluation

mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) → Measures average prediction error.

r2_score(y_test, y_pred) → Measures how well the model explains variance.

🔟 Final Interpretation

Temperature has a positive impact on bike rentals.

Humidity and windspeed negatively affect rentals.

The model explains most of the variance, indicating a good fit.

-->Most Important question in our code based on chatGPT:

Q> Multiple Linear Regression using StatsModels?

A> “We used multiple linear regression to understand how weather factors affect bike rentals and to predict total rentals.
It connects EDA → feature selection → prediction

Q> Why did you use Label Encoding instead of One-Hot Encoding?

A> Label encoding was used because the categorical variables represent ordered or limited categories, and one-hot encoding would unnecessarily increase dimensionality.

Q> If they ask ‘But one-hot is better’

A> One-hot encoding is better for nominal variables, but in this case the categories are few and meaningful, so label encoding was a reasonable trade-off between simplicity and performance.

Ordered categories → Label Encoding
Unordered categories → One-Hot Encoding
